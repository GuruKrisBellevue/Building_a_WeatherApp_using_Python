# Building_a_WeatherApp_using_Python
In this Project, a weather app was created using the Python Flask Library. The application takes different input forms, such as the zip code, city name, and state name. It returns the meteorological data such as current temperature, condition, feels like, humidity, etc., along with a customized image for the weather condition in the background.
